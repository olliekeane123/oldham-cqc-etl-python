                        "commentary": "Oldham Family Practice is an NHS GP Practice which provides primary care services to patients in Oldham, Greater Manchester. We carried out an announced assessment of one quality statement, equity in access, under the key question Responsive at Oldham Family Practice on 20 March 2024. We carried out the assessment as part of our work to understand how practices are trying to meet people\u2019s demands for access and to better understand the experiences of people who use services and providers. We recognise the work that GP practices have been engaged in to continue to provide safe, quality care to the people they serve. We know staff are carrying this out whilst the demand for general practice remains exceptionally high, with more appointments than ever being provided. However, in this challenging context, access to general practice remains a concern for people. Our strategy makes a commitment to deliver regulation driven by people\u2019s needs and experiences of care. The assessment of the quality statement equity of access includes looking at what practices are doing innovatively to improve patient access to primary care and sharing this information to drive improvement. Overall, the practice is rated as good and the key question responsive continues to be rated as providing a good service. We found that the practice had organised services to meet patients\u2019 needs, particularly those who were most likely to have difficulty accessing care. The practice sought out and used feedback and other data and information to monitor and improve access.",

The provider prioritised, allocated resources and developed opportunities as needed to tackle inequalities and achieve equity of access. The practice routinely monitored demand and capacity regarding access arrangements and had established systems to enable the ongoing analysis of appointments and core data and to seek feedback from people to learn more about their experiences.",

The data for these indicators highlighted that the performance achieved by the practice was higher than both the local and national averages. The data slightly below average satisfaction rates for patients being satisfied with the appointment they were offered.\nPrior to our assessment, we invited the practice to contact a sample of patients on our behalf so that people could give feedback on their experience regarding access. We received feedback from 7 patients and all feedback was positive.\n\nTh practice encouraged patients/patient representatives to provide feedback on their experience via the NHS friends and family test (FFT). The practice had a patient participation group (PPG). As membership was declining, they were working with other practices in the area to raise awareness so the PPG could be more involved in providing feedback for the practice and communicating with the practice population.\n\nPatients had access to an interpretation service. Double appointments were given to patients with language or communication barriers. The practice was accessible to patients with mobility needs. \n",

The leaders explained they provided opportunities and support for different groups of patient population to overcome health inequalities. The practice was a \u2018safe surgery\u2019 so patients could register without documents such as identification and proof of address. The practice was also a Homeless Friendly practice. Homeless Friendly provides a greater awareness of the difficulties and inequalities faced by homeless people and encourages organisations to help create a cultural shift in how those without a permanent home are viewed. \n\nThe leaders demonstrated they were aware of the challenges to patient access and had acted to improve patient access. We saw evidence that all data was routinely analysed. We also saw leaders engaged with other organisations to look at identifying any unmet needs of patients to ensure they were providing the required services. \n",

Nurse appointments were available from 7.30am one day a week.\n\nThe practice used a triage system to prioritise patients. had arrangements in place for prioritising patients.  A GP considered all requests and allocated an appropriate appointment. Patients were directed to other services if these were more appropriate. All staff had been trained in the triage system, and there was the capacity to add in urgent appointments during the day if needed. \n\nThe practice had recently launched a new website, improving the information available to patients.
