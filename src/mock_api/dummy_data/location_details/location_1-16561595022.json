Preventive oral health care was encouraged\nStaff kept up to date with current evidence-based practice, and had the skills, knowledge and experience to carry out their roles.\nWe looked at 6 patient care records. The information recorded in these patient care records was in line with recognised guidance. Staff obtained patients\u2019 consent for treatment in line with legislation and guidance and understood their responsibilities under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Staff described how they involved patients\u2019 relatives or carers when appropriate and made sure they had enough time to explain treatment options clearly.\n\nWe saw evidence the clinicians justified, graded and reported on the radiographs they took. \n\nThe practice had systems for the safe handling and prescribing of medicines. \nWhere applicable, patients were referred to primary and secondary care specialists for treatment the practice did not provide. This included referring patients with suspected cancer under the national two-week wait arrangements.\nStaff felt the practice supported them to develop and enabled them to take on responsibilities. \n",

Due to the nature of the building, the practice was not step-free. The practice had a hearing induction loop and information was available in large print and alternative formats. Staff also had access to language translation services to support patients.\nStaff were clear about the importance of providing emotional support to patients when delivering care. \nThe practice supported more vulnerable members of society such as patients living with dementia or adults and children with a learning disability.  \nThe practice displayed its opening hours and provided information on their website and social media page.\n\nThe frequency of appointments was agreed between the dentist and the patient, giving due regard to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. \n\nThe practice provided telephone numbers for patients needing emergency dental treatment during the working day and when the practice was not open. \n\nAt the time of our assessment, patients who needed an urgent appointment were offered one in a timely manner. When the practice was unable to offer an urgent appointment, they worked with partner organisations to support urgent access for patients. \n",

Staff password protected patients\u2019 electronic care records, and paper records were stored securely and complied with General Data Protection Regulations. \n\nThere were effective processes for undertaking audits, identifying and managing risks, investigating incidents and accidents, and for receiving and acting on safety alerts. \n\nConcerns and complaints were responded to appropriately, and outcomes were discussed to share learning and for improvement.   \n\nWe noted innovative approaches to providing person centred care. \n\nStaff demonstrated an open culture in relation to people\u2019s safety. Staff had clear responsibilities, and systems of accountability to support good governance. \n\nStaff feedback was obtained through meetings, surveys, and informal discussions. They were encouraged to offer suggestions for improvements to the service, and they said these were listened to and acted upon, where appropriate. \n\nFeedback from patients, the public and external partners was collected and responded to. \n\nThe practice had taken steps to improve environmental sustainability. For example, patients completed their medical histories online before visiting the practice, treatment plans are signed and emailed via a clinipads and the practice had all policies, risk assessments and audits online. The practice recycled all paper and cardboard.\n",
