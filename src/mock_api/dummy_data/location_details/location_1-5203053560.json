Treetops Nursing Home is a care home providing personal care and accommodation for to up to 34 people. The service provides support to older people, some of whom live with physical disabilities and sensory impairments. At the time of our assessment there were 33 people using the service. During the assessment we spoke with 10 members of staff including the registered manager, provider, nurses, senior care workers, care workers and the chef. \n\nPeople were protected from the risks of abuse and staff were trusted to keep them safe. The provider had policies and procedures in place for safeguarding to protect people from the risk of abuse. \n\nStaff were recruited safely and had the necessary safety checks in place before starting work. Staff received an induction when they first started working at the service and training relevant to their roles. Suitable staffing arrangements were in place. People gave positive feedback about the staff who supported them and the management team.\n\nPeople were encouraged by staff to remain as independent as possible and were given appropriate support to do so. Care plans promoted people\u2019s right to independence and choice. Person-centred care was promoted. Staff knew people\u2019s support needs and preferences well.\n\nThe service worked in partnership with other professionals to meet people\u2019s needs. Referrals were made to other medical services when required.\n\nComplaints had been responded to.
