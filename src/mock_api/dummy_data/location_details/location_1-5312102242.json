People were protected from the risks of abuse and staff were trusted to keep them safe. The registered manager understood safeguarding policies and procedures. Staff we spoke with were confident to report concerns. The registered manager responded positively to feedback about moving and handling procedures and took immediate action to mitigate an identified risk. Staff received an induction, ongoing training, and felt supported by the management team. The home was clean and tidy and staff wore appropriate personal protective equipment. Documentation and audits relating to medicines management required improvement.  Relatives were able to visit the service at any time. Staff encouraged people to be independent and offered people choice, but further development was needed to support choices for people living with a diagnosis of dementia. The management team sought regular feedback from staff and residents and acted on this. The management team was committed to caring for people safely and were receptive to feedback from the inspector during the assessment. We spoke with 9 members of staff including the provider, registered manager, deputy, activity co-ordinator, chef, senior care workers and care workers. ",

Staff were well supported and felt able to make suggestions and come up with ideas for improvements. People could receive visitors when they wished but said they would like to see more activities on offer.",

Although choice was offered during meal times and we observed staff asking people what they would like for their lunch, some people could not engage with the questions and would have benefited from more dementia friendly strategies when offering choices. Meaningful activities were not always provided. We observed people taking part in a game of bingo, however most people were withdrawn and could not engage with the game.",

One staff member told us, \"My induction and training was good. Everyone [staff] were friendly and helpful. I did 2 weeks of shadow shifts [observing experienced members of staff].\" Staff had regular training and opportunities for supervision [one to one support sessions with their line manager]. A staff member commented, \u201cI get regular one to one [supervisions]. They are fine.\" The provider used a dependency tool and had systems in place to monitor staffing levels. However, we received mixed feedback from staff. Some staff felt they needed more staff during busy periods. We fed this back to the provider who assured us they would review their staffing structures. Some staff raised concerns with us about night staff occasionally falling asleep on shift. We fed this back to the registered manager who explained an incident had occurred previously in relation to staff sleeping on shift and the staff members involved were subject to the provider's internal disciplinary process. The registered manager conducted additional night checks during inspection process and no concerns were found. The registered manager assured us the number of unannounced night check would be increased. \n",

Staff had received Dementia training, however not all staff we observed and spoke to had good knowledge of supporting people with Dementia. A relative told us, \"I feel they [staff] need to have more dementia training.

The provider used satisfaction surveys to ask people for their views and therefore improve service delivery. Staff meetings were also held to enable staff to discuss the problems they might have affecting their work. Although the management team and the provider carried out various audits in the service, auditing systems required improvement. The medicine audits did not pick up on the recording issues we found during the inspection. Care plan audits took place regularly, however, the audit tool used was not robust and did not review the quality of care records. The provider operated an on-call system to ensure staff had access to management support during out of hours.
